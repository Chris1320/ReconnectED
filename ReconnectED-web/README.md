ReconnectED is a digital detox planner that helps reduce screen time. It includes a daily planner to set screen time goals, and goal-setting sections.

Assisted by its smart AI Companion App, it provides prompts and support to stay on track.

In today's Digital Age, constant content consumption fuels screen dependency and information overload, affecting well-being and productivity. Rising digital demand harms the environment, while device production depletes natural resources. Let's stay mindful of our digital habits and find inspiration in a balanced, healthier lifestyle.
